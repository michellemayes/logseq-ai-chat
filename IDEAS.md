Analyzing the codebase to identify Logseq-specific improvements:


[4 tools called]

Here are Logseq-specific features that add value:

## High-value features

### 1. Block reference operations
- Create block references: `((block-id))` in AI responses
- Query/retrieve specific blocks by ID
- Link AI responses to blocks
- Navigate to referenced blocks

### 2. Graph traversal and discovery
- "Show pages connected to X" (backlinks + forward links)
- "Find related pages about Y" (graph traversal)
- Relationship visualization (show connections)
- Discover orphaned pages

### 3. Temporal intelligence
- "What did I write about last week?" (journal date queries)
- Track changes over time
- Compare journal entries across dates
- Identify recurring patterns in journals

### 4. Property-based intelligence
- Query by properties: "Find pages where `status:: active`"
- Suggest properties based on content
- Bulk update properties
- Extract properties from unstructured text

### 5. Task management integration
- Query TODO/DOING/DONE items
- Update task status via chat
- "What tasks are due this week?"
- Generate task summaries from journals

### 6. Logseq query builder
- Generate Logseq queries from natural language
- "Show me all pages tagged #project with status active"
- Execute queries and display results
- Save queries as reusable templates

### 7. Template generation
- Create Logseq templates from examples
- Generate templates for common patterns (meeting notes, project tracking)
- Auto-populate templates with AI-generated content

### 8. Namespace-aware operations
- "Create a page in the Projects namespace"
- Understand hierarchical page structures
- Bulk operations on namespaces
- Namespace-based filtering

### 9. Tag intelligence
- Suggest tags based on content
- Tag analysis: "What tags are most common?"
- Auto-tag new content
- Find content by tag combinations

### 10. Block-level editing
- Edit specific blocks without affecting parents/siblings
- Move blocks between pages
- Merge blocks
- Convert blocks to pages

## Recommended priority

1. Block reference operations — adds direct block linking
2. Temporal intelligence — leverages journal dates
3. Task management integration — uses TODO markers
4. Logseq query builder — enables powerful queries
